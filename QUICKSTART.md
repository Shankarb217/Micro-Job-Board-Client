- Sample user data

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If port 3000 is busy, Vite will automatically use the next available port (3001, 3002, etc.)

### Dependencies Not Installing
```bash
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Delete node_modules and package-lock.json
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Reinstall
npm install
```

### Build Errors
Make sure you're using Node.js version 18 or higher:
```bash
node --version
```

## Next Steps

1. **Explore all pages** - Navigate through different user roles
2. **Test forms** - Try all form validations
3. **Check responsiveness** - Resize browser to see mobile layout
4. **Review code** - Check the clean architecture implementation
5. **Connect backend** - When ready, update API base URL

## Tips

- Use browser DevTools to inspect Redux state
- Check Network tab to see API calls (currently mocked)
