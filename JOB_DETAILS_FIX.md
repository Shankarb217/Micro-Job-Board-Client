# ✅ Job Details Page - Final Fix

## 🎯 Issue Description

**Problem**: Clicking "View Details" button was showing weird behavior:
- Sometimes showed "Application added successfully" alert
- Sometimes navigated to applications page immediately
- Didn't show job details properly

**Root Cause**: The `applySuccess` state was persisting and triggering navigation even when user just wanted to view job details, not apply.

---

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### Added Submission Tracking Flag

```javascript
const [hasSubmitted, setHasSubmitted] = useState(false);
```

This flag tracks whether the user actually submitted an application in the current session.

### Flow Control

```javascript
// When viewing job details
useEffect(() => {
  dispatch(resetApplications());
  dispatch(getJobById(id));
  setHasSubmitted(false); // Reset flag ✅
}, [dispatch, id]);

// Only navigate if user actually submitted
useEffect(() => {
  if (applySuccess && hasSubmitted) { // Check both conditions ✅
    alert('Application submitted successfully!');
    dispatch(resetApplications());
    setHasSubmitted(false);
    navigate('/my-applications');
  }
}, [applySuccess, hasSubmitted, navigate, dispatch]);

// Set flag when user submits
const handleApplySubmit = () => {
  setHasSubmitted(true); // Mark as submitted ✅
  dispatch(applyToJob({ jobId: id, applicationData }));
  setOpenApplyDialog(false);
};
```
