### 4. **RoleBasedHome.jsx** - Router Component
**Purpose:**

- Shows public HomePage for non-authenticated users
- Seamless role-based routing

## 🎯 How It Works

### User Flow:

1. **Not Logged In** → Public HomePage (job search)
2. **Seeker Login** → SeekerHomePage (personalized dashboard)
3. **Employer Login** → EmployerHomePage (job management)
4. **Admin Login** → AdminHomePage (platform overview)

### Routing Logic:

```javascript
// In RoleBasedHome.jsx
if (!user) return <HomePage />;

switch (user.role) {
  case 'Admin': return <AdminHomePage />;
  case 'Employer': return <EmployerHomePage />;
  case 'Seeker': return <SeekerHomePage />;
  default: return <HomePage />;
}
```
