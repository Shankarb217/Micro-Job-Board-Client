# 🔒 Access Control & Role-Based Routing Fixes

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Protected Route Behavior**
**Problem**: Users saw "Access Denied" error messages when trying to access unauthorized pages.

**Solution**: Changed `ProtectedRoute` component to redirect users to home page instead of showing error message.

**File**: `src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx`
- Now redirects to `/` (home) if user doesn't have required role
- Cleaner UX - no error messages shown
- Users are silently redirected to appropriate pages

### 2. **Applications Page Access**
**Problem**: Applications page showed "Employer role required" error when accessed without a jobId parameter.

**Solution**: Added proper validation and user-friendly message.

**File**: `src/pages/ApplicationsPage.jsx`
- Added check for `jobId` parameter
- Shows informative message if no jobId provided
- Prevents unnecessary API calls
- Fixed field name mismatches (`seekerName` vs `applicantName`)

### 3. **Field Name Consistency**
**Problem**: Mock data uses `seekerName` and `seekerEmail`, but components expected `applicantName` and `applicantEmail`.

**Solution**: Updated components to handle both field names.

**Files Updated**:
- `src/pages/ApplicationsPage.jsx` - Uses fallback for both naming conventions
- `src/components/Navbar.jsx` - Fixed user name display

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Role-Based Access Control

#### **Seeker Role**
- ✅ Can access: Home, Jobs, My Applications, Profile
- ❌ Cannot access: Post Job, My Jobs, Applications (employer), Admin
- 🔄 Redirects to home if trying to access unauthorized pages

#### **Employer Role**
- ✅ Can access: Home, Post Job, My Jobs, Applications, Profile
- ❌ Cannot access: My Applications (seeker), Admin
- 🔄 Redirects to home if trying to access unauthorized pages

#### **Admin Role**
- ✅ Can access: All pages including Admin Dashboard
- 🔄 Full access to all features

### Navigation Flow

1. **User tries to access protected route**
   - ProtectedRoute checks if user is logged in
   - If not logged in → Redirect to `/login`
   - If logged in but wrong role → Redirect to `/` (home)
   - If correct role → Show page

2. **Navbar shows only relevant links**
   - Seeker sees: Home, Jobs, My Applications
   - Employer sees: Home, Post Job, My Jobs, Applications
   - Admin sees: Home, Admin Dashboard, My Jobs

3. **Applications Page**
   - Accessed from "My Jobs" page with jobId parameter
   - If no jobId → Shows friendly message
   - If wrong role → Redirects to home

## 🔧 Technical Details

### ProtectedRoute Component
```javascript
// Before: Showed error message
if (!allowedRoles.includes(user.role)) {
  return <Alert>Access Denied</Alert>;
}

// After: Redirects silently
if (!allowedRoles.includes(user.role)) {
  return <Navigate to="/" replace />;
}
```

### Applications Page Guard
```javascript
// Added early return if no jobId
if (!jobId) {
  return (
    <Alert severity="info">
      Please select a job from "My Jobs" to view its applications.
    </Alert>
  );
}
```

### Field Name Compatibility
```javascript
// Handles both naming conventions
{application.seekerName || application.applicantName}
{application.seekerEmail || application.applicantEmail}
```
